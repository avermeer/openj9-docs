## Features and changes

### jextract now available on macOS for OpenJDK version 8

The [`jextract` tool](tool_jextract.md) is now available on macOS&reg; platforms (as well as AIX&reg; and Linux&reg;) for _all_ current versions of OpenJDK: 8, 11, and 13.

### New shared classes cache suboption to turn off timestamp checking

You can set the `-Xshareclasses:noTimestampChecks` option to turn off timestamp checking in shared classes. For more information, see the [-Xshareclasses:noTimestampChecks](xshareclasses.md#notimestampchecks) option.

### `-Xmso` 1 MB minimum value on z/OS 64-bit

On z/OS 64-bit, [`-Xmso`](xmso.md) has a 1 MB minimum value, to match the minimum stack space provided by the operating system. If you set a value smaller than 1 MB, the value is ignored.

### [-XX:+TransparentHugePage is enabled by default on more Linux systems

[-XX:+TransparentHugePage](xxtransparenthugepage.md) is enabled by default on Linux&reg; systems for POWER and IBM Z as well as x86 systems. This option takes affect only when Transparent Huge Pages (THP) is set to `madvise` on your system. When transparent Huge Pages are used, your application footprint might increase.

### Add new Xdump exit agent and ExitOnOutOfMemoryError option

The new Xdump agent "exit" shuts down the VM when the specified event occurs. The "exit" agent is at priority level 0 and "tool" agent has been moved to priority level 1 to aid in mimicking the behavior of HotSpot options. See [Xdump dump agents](xdump.md#dump-agents) for more about agents.

OpenJ9 now supports the HotSpot option `-XX:[+-]ExitOnOutOfMemoryError`. You can set this option to have the VM shut down when a java.lang.OutOfMemory error is thrown by the VM or in Java code. See the [-XX:[+-]ExitOnOutOfMemoryError](xxexitonoutofmemory.md) option.

The Xdump "exit" agent is used in the implementation of `-XX:[+-]ExitOnOutOfMemoryError`.

### LUDCL caching enabled by default
By caching the Latest User Defined Class Loader (LUDCL), Java applications that use deserialization extensively can see a performance improvement. This
capability is controlled by the [-Dcom.ibm.enableClassCaching](dcomibmenableclasscaching.md) system property and is now enabled by default. This feature was disabled for the 0.17.0 release due to [issue #7332](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/7332) which has now been resolved.

### Terabytes suffix support for -X and -XX options that take a size
OpenJ9 now support 't' and 'T' suffixes (indicating terabytes) for -X and -XX options that take a `<size>` parameter.
